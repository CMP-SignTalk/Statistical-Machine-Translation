we must approach our own with the same sense of responsibility and realism .
the european union has a major role to play .
it is immeasurable .
how and when will it be provided ?
it seems that not only is there no financial clarification , but there is also no political clarification .
this is especially true of its uniform and balanced approach to the union's enlargement policy .

this is one of our top priorities .
third , what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restrictions ?
i congratulate the president , since he was present at the european council meeting .
it is not an unimportant element of this debate .

however , for one fallen wall , how many others have been erected on our continent ?
i think it would be good to say something about the eastern partnership .
responsibility for social housing is fully within the competence of national , regional and local authorities .
