Preprocessing: In your preprocessing step, you are converting all the words to lowercase, tokenizing them using the word_tokenize function from the nltk library, and adding the special start and end tokens <s> and </s> to each sentence. These are standard preprocessing steps and are commonly used in language modeling. However, you may want to consider additional preprocessing steps such as removing punctuation, stop words, and numbers, depending on your use case.

Vocabulary filtering: You are filtering out low-frequency words from your vocabulary based on a minimum frequency threshold. This is a good practice as it helps reduce the size of the vocabulary and improves the efficiency of the model. However, you may want to experiment with different minimum frequency thresholds to see how it affects the performance of your model.

Handling unknown words: In your implementation, you are handling unknown words by adding a special <unk> token to the vocabulary and assigning a count of 1 to it. This is a common approach to handling unknown words in language modeling. However, you may want to consider more sophisticated methods such as using subword units (e.g., byte pair encoding) or training a neural language model that can better handle out-of-vocabulary words.

Probability calculation: You are using add-k smoothing to calculate the probabilities of words. Add-k smoothing is a simple and effective method for smoothing probabilities in language modeling. However, you may want to experiment with different smoothing methods such as Good-Turing smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing, or interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing to see how they affect the performance of your model.

Performance evaluation: You are calculating the probability and log-probability of sentences using your language model. This is a good way to evaluate the performance of your model. However, you may want to consider additional evaluation metrics such as perplexity, which is a commonly used metric in language modeling.

---------------------------------
In general, perplexity values between 10 and 100 are considered good for language models.
